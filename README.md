## Branch behavior

Adds explicit actions to play a browsed item now while keeping the queue, append it, or replace the queue.

This v5.4 branch also preserves an explicitly selected queue item while ExoPlayer replaces media sources. Internal timeline and source-removal events cannot reset the selection to the previous item; normal playback transitions and seeks still update it.
