## Branch behavior

Defers fullscreen requests until the player and its listeners are ready.

This v5.4 branch also preserves an explicitly selected queue item while ExoPlayer replaces media sources. Internal timeline and source-removal events cannot reset the selection to the previous item; normal playback transitions and seeks still update it.
